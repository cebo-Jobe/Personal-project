Game Description:

Bubble Clicker is a fast-paced, interactive game where players must click on expanding and shrinking bubbles before they disappear. 
The game starts with bubbles spawning at random positions on the screen at regular intervals, and players must react quickly to hit the targets.
The bubbles grow to a maximum size before starting to shrink, and if they shrink completely without being clicked, the player loses a life.
The game features a clean and simple interface with dynamic gameplay, offering a fun challenge that tests the player's reaction speed and precision.

Game Objective:

The objective of Bubble Clicker is to click as many bubbles as possible before they disappear from the screen.
Players must manage their accuracy and speed to maximize their score, aiming to pop each bubble before it shrinks out of view.
With a limited number of lives, every missed bubble brings the player closer to the game's end. 
The player's performance is measured in terms of hits, speed (targets clicked per second), and accuracy.
The goal is to achieve the highest score possible before running out of lives.
